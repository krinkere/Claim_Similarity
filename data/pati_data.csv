14208585,2014-03-13,WHAT IS CLAIMED IS: ***.     A rotational atherectomy system  comprising: an elongated flexible non-oscillating drive shaft having a lumen therethrough  a rotational axis and a distal end; and an oscillating section attached proximate the distal end of the elongated non-oscillating drive shaft and comprising: a radially offsetting drive shaft attachment attached to the non-oscillating drive shaft and having a centered lumen therethrough  the centered lumen in fluid communication with the lumen of the non-oscillating drive shaft and further being coincident with the rotational axis of the non-oscillating drive shaft  and an attachment point radially offset from the centered lumen; and a flexible oscillating drive shaft attached to the attachment point of the radially offsetting drive shaft attachment; and an abrading head attached to the flexible oscillating drive shaft. ***2.    The rotational atherectomy system of claim 1  further comprising a guide wire within the lumen of the elongated flexible non-oscillating drive shaft and over which the non-oscillating drive shaft may be advanced or retracted. ***3.    The rotational atherectomy system of claim 2  further comprising advancing or retracting the oscillating section when the non-oscillating drive shaft is advanced or retracted over the guide wire. ***4.    The rotational atherectomy system of claim 1  wherein the radially offsetting drive shaft attachment is circular.   ***5.    The rotational atherectomy system of claim 1  the abrading head comprising a resting diameter and arranged during rotational operation of the system to achieve a working diameter that is greater than the resting diameter. ***6.     The rotational atherectomy system of claim 1  further comprising the oscillating drive shaft having a rotational axis. ***7.     The rotational atherectomy system of claim 6  further comprising the abrading head being concentric and comprising a center of mass that is coincident with the rotational axis of the oscillating drive shaft. ***8.    The rotational atherectomy system of claim 6  further comprising the abrading head being concentric and having a center of mass that is radially offset from the rotational axis of the oscillating drive shaft. ***9.     The rotational atherectomy system of claim 6  further comprising the abrading head being eccentric and comprising a center of mass that is radially offset from the rotational axis of the oscillating drive shaft. ***10.   The rotational atherectomy system of claim 9  wherein the abrading head is geometrically eccentric. ***11.   The rotational atherectomy system of claim 9  wherein the abrading head comprises materials of differing densities.  ***,HSQEFT25PXXIFW3
